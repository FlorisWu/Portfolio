## Code and Design

### Sentiment analysis

During the fall of 2018, as part of my data journalism research for [Storybench](http://www.storybench.org), a "cookbook for digital storytelling" by Northeastern University's School of Journalism, I collected twitter data from 2018 midterm election candidates (with R) to see how it might have affected the results of the election. To better understand the impact of these words, a machine learning model was used to predict tweet sentiment, and results are visualized (with Python). [Code here](https://floriswu.github.io/twitter-sentiment-analysis/).

An analysis of 70,000 tweets from more than 60 candidates running for the Senate in 2018 shows Democrats who employed more negative tweets fared better.

### Heatmaps

In the summer of 2018, as part of [#ARforChange](http://www.storybench.org/arforchange-project-using-immersive-technologies-data-social-change/), a project exploring new platforms for civic engagement and social change using immersive media at Northeastern University's School of Journalism, I collected flight data and presented them through heatmaps to visualize the unfair burden of aircraft noise over West Boston with Python.

### Satellite trajectory

During my freshman year studying physics at Imperial College London, I did a Python project plotting the motion and energies of a satellite travelling around Mars. [Code here](https://floriswu.github.io/satellite-around-Mars/).

### Optical ray tracer

During my sophomore year studying physics at Imperial College London, I did a Python project tracing a single and a bundle of rays propagating through different medium (refraction). [Code here](https://floriswu.github.io/optical-ray-tracer/).
